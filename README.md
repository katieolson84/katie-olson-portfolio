> I have created this portfolio to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following:

<p>React.js: structured code that is easy to understand and scalable</p>
<p>Styled Components: all styles are on the seperate components aside from global styles which are applied in the App</p>

## Install

```sh
npm start
```
